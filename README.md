## Usage

### Global dependencies

Make sure you have Node 14 installed. The project supports nvm:
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/)
- [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm)

### Install dependencies

```
npm install
```

### Run development server

```
npm run dev
```

Will open your default browser to http://localhost:8080/public

Webpack will watch for changes in the `./src` directory and output the bundled assets to `./public/assets`. In parallel, the development server will watch for changes in the `./public` directory and live reload the browser.

### Build production bundles

```
npm run build
```

Will compile, minify and autoprefix Sass to CSS. Will Minify and uglify JavaScript and output the bundled assets to `./public/assets`.

### Assets

All the `designs, icons and images` needed to implement the designs are added to the `./public/assets/images` directory.

## Stack

The boilerplate consists of following tech stack and should run out of the box with a basic setup - 

- Webpack
- Sass compilation (and minification/autoprefixing in production)
- ES6+ transpilation (and minification/uglyfication in production)
- ES Modules

## Questions

- Q: How much time do I have?
- A: Try to limit your time to 4 hours total.

- Q: Can I use React or another framework or library?
- A: Yes if you really want to, but please build the main requested UI elements (FAQ and modal) yourself.

If you have any other questions while working on the exercise feel free to reach out. We will be happy to help.

Happy coding!
